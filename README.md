# Template repository for creating new RET plugins

This GitHub template can be used to easily scaffold a new [RET](https://github.com/rabobank/ret-engineering-tools) plugin.
Simply click on "Use this template" and fill in a repository name and description.

After clicking the create button, you will have a new repository that looks very similar to this one. 
If you are reading this in your own newly created repo: congrats! Your scaffolded plugin will appear in a minute or so (after a refresh). In the meantime, enjoy this waiting music:
